# Thoughts
An app to capture a thought and then manage or expand upon that thought.

The Thoughts App is a place where you can store your thoughts, expand on these thoughts, categorize them, search them, and so on.  A thought is in it's simplest form, a single piece of information.  

The app will be multi-user, meaning that the system can accomodate multiple user accounts.  Each user will have to initially register to create an account.  Going forward, they will have to log in to use the application.  Each users thought can only be viewed by the user that created them.
